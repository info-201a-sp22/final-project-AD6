This chart illustrates the comparison between the racial compositions of schools versus the average SAT score of schools. This data provides valuable insight into the issues of injustice within the public school system since there is a positive correlation between SAT scores and racial compositions for Asian and White students and a negative correlation between SAT scores and racial compositions for Black and Hispanic students. This points to the need for future research into disparities in funding and resources for schools with higher Black and Hispanic populations.
